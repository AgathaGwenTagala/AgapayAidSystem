			<h6>Why?</h6>
			<p class="text-justify">The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), the Philippines' primary agency for disaster response, underlined in the Joint Memorandum Circular No. 01, Series of 2013, Guidelines on Evacuation Center Coordination and Management (ECCM), that safeguarding the safety and well-being of people, along with their animals, during natural or human-induced disasters is a paramount government priority.

			<h6 class="text-light">Do you know?</h6>
			<p class="text-justify">In 2022, the World Risk Report ranked the Philippines as the most disaster-prone country, primarily due to its high susceptibility to natural calamities such as earthquakes, typhoons, storm surges, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and flooding. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Philippines faced the onslaught of 22 tropical storms, resulting in devastating floods and landslides, displacing many Filipinos who sought refuge in evacuation centers.</p>
